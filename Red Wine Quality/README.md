# Red Wine Quality Prediction

- The data for this project was fetched from [Red Wine Quality Data](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009).
- I have performed exploratory data analysis and statistical inference.
- I have applied linear machine learning models to predict the quality column using the other 11 features and to predict the alcohol column using the other 11 features. This should include the analysis of model selection using the statistical significance of each feature, R-squared, at least one popular information criteria, and other methods.
