**Plan for Risk Evaluation Startup's Data Investigation and POC Building:**

**Assumptions:**
1. The dataset from Home Credit Group is relevant and contains meaningful information for predicting credit risk.
2. Machine learning models can effectively capture statistical patterns in loan defaults.
3. The startup is in the early stages of development, with limited resources and time.

**Overall Objectives:**
- Develop a proof-of-concept (POC) product that showcases our machine learning models' capabilities in predicting credit risk.
- Identify key features and metrics to measure model performance.

**Step 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing**
- Objective: Gain a deep understanding of the dataset and prepare it for analysis.
- Tasks:
  - Load and explore the Home Credit Group dataset.
  - Handle missing data, outliers, and data imbalances.
  - Identify potential features that might be relevant for credit risk prediction.
  - Split the dataset into training and validation sets.

**Step 2: Feature Engineering**
- Objective: Create meaningful features that can improve model performance.
- Tasks:
  - Generate new features based on dataset insights.
  - Perform feature scaling and normalization as necessary.
  - Explore techniques like one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
  - Consider feature selection methods to identify the most important variables.

**Step 3: Model Selection**
- Objective: Choose a set of machine learning models for credit risk prediction.
- Tasks:
  - Research and select a diverse range of algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting).
  - Define evaluation criteria (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC) for model performance.
  - Implement a baseline model for benchmarking.
  - Train and evaluate each model on the training/validation data.

**Step 4: Model Optimization**
- Objective: Improve the selected models' performance.
- Tasks:
  - Fine-tune hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or Bayesian optimization.
  - Implement model-specific optimizations (e.g., XGBoost's early stopping).

**Step 5: Model Interpretability**
- Objective: Ensure transparency and interpretability of the models.
- Tasks:
  - Use techniques like SHAP values or feature importance scores to explain model predictions.
  - Create visualizations and dashboards to present model insights to potential clients.

**Step 6: POC Building**
- Objective: Develop a user-friendly POC product for demonstration.
- Tasks:
  - Build a simple web-based interface for clients to interact with the models.
  - Integrate the selected machine learning models into the interface.
  - Implement a backend for data handling and predictions.
  - Ensure the POC is user-friendly and visually appealing.
