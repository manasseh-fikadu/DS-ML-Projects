# Stroke Prediction

Dear reviewer/reader, please try to look at this readme file before moving on. 

- The web app can be found via this link https://loan-prediction-051v.onrender.com/ This might take some time to load since it is hosted on a free tier.

- The API I used which is deployed on the platform Render. The reason I used render and not GCP is because in our country credit card access is not available and I couldn't use the well known cloud providers.

- I have also confirmed that with Gierdrius that I can use other platforms.
