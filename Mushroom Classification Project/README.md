# Mushroom Classification

**Introduction:**
Mushroom Classification is a machine learning project that aims to identify different species of mushrooms based on images. This project can have practical applications in the field of mycology, helping to distinguish edible and toxic mushrooms.

**Dataset:**
The dataset contains images of various mushroom species, primarily focusing on common Northern European genuses. These include Agaricus, Amanita, Boletus, Cortinarius, Entoloma, Hygrocybe, Lactarius, Russula, and Suillus.
